# Using Folium and GeoCoding in Python 

## Preparing the environment

For this project I'm using Python version `3.10.5`, and the module `venv` to create the environment:

console
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate

Problem Statement

House Predection System Predict land/house prices based on the geo location data and visualize over maps

Proposed Solution

A housing price analysis framework based on geographic big data. First, based on the hedonic price model and geographic big data. Then, data will be used for statistical and spatial analysis to explore the law of spatial distribution of housing prices. Finally, zonal nonlinear feature models are developed to conduct a regression analysis of housing prices and related factors.
