## Problem Statement

House Predection System Predict land/house prices based on the geo location data and visualize over maps.

## Using Folium and GeoCoding in Python 

## Preparing the environment

For this project I'm using Python version `3.10.5`, and the module `venv` to create the environment:

console
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate

## Installing required packages

console
(.env) $ cd HereTech/
(.env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt includes folium, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scikit-learn


## Proposed Solution

A housing price analysis framework based on geographic big data. First, based on the hedonic price model and geographic big data. Then, data will be used for statistical and spatial analysis to explore the law of spatial distribution of housing prices. Finally, zonal nonlinear feature models are developed to conduct a regression analysis of housing prices and related factors.
